# \<Name of Project Repository>
Provide a tl;dr on what the system does.

# tools / installation
This setion should start with a tl;dr about which tools are used, what the tools do, and why they were chosen. If there is a critical functionality being provided by the tool it should be specified what it is and where it is needed. It should generally be done as shown below.


> [Tool 1 (this should also link to the tools md file)](tools.md)

Tool 1 was chosen because it is important for this functionality, it also has pre-built interoperability with this other thing, which is useful since we use that as well. If another alternative was considered it can be mentioned here, that way it is easy to find if problems arise from this tool later on and it has to be removed from the project. If applicable, a link to the tools own documentation or website/github should be provided *here*.
