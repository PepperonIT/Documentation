# Python 2.7
## Windows
Install python 2.7 on [python installers](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2718/).

## Ubuntu
On ubuntu it is not enough to have ubuntu, you also need to install python2.7-dev: \
To install python 2.7 run the command:
```
sudo apt install python2.7 
```

Then to install python2.7-dev run:
```
sudo apt install python2.7-dev

# naoqi
## Ubuntu
Download and extract the [Python SDK](https://developer.softbankrobotics.com/pepper-naoqi-25-downloads-linux).

The SDK then needs to be added to the python path, to get the path open the naoqi folder in a terminal and navigate to:
> ~/lib/python2.7/site-packages/

In the terminal run the "path working directory" command:
```
pwd
```
This prints out the path we need to add to python. To do this open the bashrc file and append the export statement, this can for example be:
```
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/home/anders/Documents/naoqi/pynaoqi-python2.7-2.5.7.1-linux64/lib/python2.7/site-packages
```

To verify that it works, open a new terminal and run:
```
python2.7
```
And import naoqi
```
import naoqi
```

To further verify, you can run:
```
from naoqi import ALProxy
```
```
tts = ALProxy("ALTextToSpeech", "130.240.238.32", 9559)
```
```
tts.say("Hello, world!")
```
